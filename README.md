# Scratch-Pad

* I find that very often its important to not only practice just basic code, but to practice and learn new things with code, methods, functions etc.
    * this repo is just designed to hold code as a scratch pad and to push up new code upon learning new things. I try to pick a few things a week
    that I may have struggled to understand or struggle to see how it works as well as just hitting the fundimentals of JS/Node as its important to 
    always remember the basics and to build on your knowledge.
    * All this code examples are things I know but sometimes when writing complicated code you at times forget the basics so its something I like to
    freshen up on every so often
